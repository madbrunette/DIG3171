<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
<p>Hi everyone. My name is listed as Nicole on my Canvas account but I go by Nikki. I have a background in psychology; however, I'm now a Communication major and Digital Humanities minor. My work experience is mostly just retail. I'd like to learn more about technology and how it can enhance what I want to do in the future. Technology has rapidly become an important part of life and so I want to be competent at it.

<h2>Why Github? </h2>  
    <p>This is just one more skill that can help you stand out in the job market! There is a big push for technical documents to be treated as code–and even to write them in the same software as code–for software and technical companies. Plus, Github pages use Markdown, which is another impressive skill for your resume.
