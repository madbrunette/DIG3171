<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
<p>Hi everyone. My name is listed as Nicole on my Canvas account but I go by Nikki. I have a background in psychology; however, I'm now a Communication major and Digital Humanities minor. My work experience is mostly just retail. I'd like to learn more about technology and how it can enhance what I want to do in the future. Technology has rapidly become an important part of life and so I want to be competent at it.
