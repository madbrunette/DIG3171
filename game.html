  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>My narrative was created to show the player that only choosing negative/regressive options can limit ourselves. In order to grow, we must try to pick the hard choice. It may be uncomofrtable but going forward is the only choice in order to beat obstacles in our lives. </p>
